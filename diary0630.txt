Dear Diary,

Today I learned R markdown to edit my work.
Here are some basic tips:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is an R markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring webpages.

Use an asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such as *italics* or **bold**

create lists with a dash:
-Item1
-Item2
-Item3

```
Use back ticks to create a block of code
```

Embed LaTax or MathML equations,
$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$

or even footnotes, citations, and a bibliography. [^1]

[^1]: markdown is great

with R markdown, you can insert R code chunks including plots:

```{r qplot, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, message=FALSE}
#quick summary and plot
library(ggplot2)
summary(cars)
qplot(speed, dist, data=cars)+
      geom_smooth()
```
